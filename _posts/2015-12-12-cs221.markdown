Modified a Python-based framework to calculate the delta-v for the transfer between the Earth-Moon 
L2 Lyapunov orbit and Sun-Earth L4 planar orbit. 


Now hosted at [http://doctorbayes.com](http://doctorbayes.com){:target="_blank"} I rebuilt this project from scratch (without the use of other libraries) in both Python and Javascript. The source code is available on my [github](https://github.com/leonidk/drbayes){:target="_blank"}.
